# Sorting Algorithms
- 0: Bubble sort
- 1: Insertion sort
- 2: Selection sort
- 3: Quick sort (Lomuto partition scheme)
- 100: (4) Shell sort (Knuth sequence)
- 102: (6) Counting sort
- 104: (8) Heap sort (sift-down)
- 105: (9) Radix sort (LSD)
- 107: (11) Quick sort (Hoare partition scheme)

## *-O files have big-O notations for time complexity of the corresponding algoritm with one notation per line (in order):
- best case
- average case
- worst case
